**DISCLAIMER** This project is for learning purpose.

The project has two parts

**PART 1**

**Description**

A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process. She wanted help in identifying which individuals are most likely to click on her ads.

In this project I did EDA to determine individuals that are most likely to click cryptography course ads by a Kenyan entrepreneur and also build a model using decision tree to predict individuals likely to click on the ad.

To successfully conduct this project I used CRISP DM;

-Business understanding
